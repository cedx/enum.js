# Installation

## Requirements
Before installing **Enums for JS**, you need to make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), the Node.js package manager, up and running.
		
You can verify if you're already good to go with the following command:

``` shell
node --version
# v21.7.2
```

## Installing with npm package manager

### 1. Install it
From a command prompt, run:

``` shell
npm install @cedx/enum
```

### 2. Import it
Now in your [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) code, you can use:

``` js
import Enum from "@cedx/enum";
```
