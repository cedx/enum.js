# Enums <small>for JS</small>

## Yet another implementation of enumerated types
This implementation does not try to reproduce the semantics of traditional enumerations, like the ones found in C# or Java languages.
It just gives a set of static methods to ease working with the values of an object literal representing an enumerated type.

## Quick start
Install the latest version of **Enums for JS** with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com):

```shell
npm install @cedx/enum
```

For detailed instructions, see the [installation guide](installation.md).
